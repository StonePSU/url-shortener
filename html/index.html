        <h2>URL Shortener Microservice</h2>
        <h3>By Matt Krell</h3>
        <p>This is a FreeCodeCamp back-end certification challenge and is designed to meet the following user stories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.</li>
            <li>If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.</li>
            <li>When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.</li>
        </ul>
